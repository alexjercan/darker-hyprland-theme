## Quickstart

For now check <https://github.com/hyprland-community/hyprtheme>

```console
mkdir -p ~/.config/hypr/themes
cd ~/.config/hypr/themes
git clone git@github.com:alexjercan/darker-hyprland-theme.git darker
hyprtheme enable darker
```

## Dependencies

The applications you will need installed to be able to use the theme fully. The
theme will be applied only to these applications. (In case you don't have them
it will probably just skip them since it is a bash script)
